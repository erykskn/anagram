# anagram

An anagram is a reordering of the letters in a word of phrase. For example, you can rearrange the letters of terraced to get the word retraced. Rearranging them some more will give you the word cratered. You can even make dactrere and redatrec, which are both anagrams of terraced even if they are not legitimate English words.
